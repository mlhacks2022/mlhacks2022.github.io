        Hi <?= teacher.prefix ?> <?= teacher.last_name ?>!
    </p>
    <p>
        Me and a couple other students from Foothill High School and Amador Valley High 
        School are running ML Hacks, a free online hackathon for girls and 
        non-binary high school students (trans included), from May 20 to May 22. 
        We would love it if students from all over the Bay Area (and the country) 
        could participate! We will run a project competition for prizes, where hackers 
        can make anything from a 
        website to an app or a game, as well as attend workshops for coding basics, 
        computer science applications, and AI/machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Would you be willing to tell your students about our hackathon and 
        encourage them to join? It will be a great opportunity for more 
        female/non-binary students to explore different areas of CS in an exciting 
        and welcoming environment and get free swag. 
    </p>
